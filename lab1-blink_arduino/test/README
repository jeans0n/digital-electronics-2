### Morse code

1. Listing of C code which repeats one "dot" and one "comma" (BTW, in Morse code it is letter `A`) on a LED. Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow C guidelines:

```c
int main(void)
{
    // Set pin where on-board LED is connected as output
    #define LED_RED   PB0
    #define PB0 8

    pinMode(LED_RED, OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(LED_RED, HIGH);

    // Infinite loop
    while (1)
    {
        digitalWrite(LED_RED, LOW);   // The LED is turned on (active LOW)

        _delay_ms(100); // it stays on for 100 ms to represent the dot of the letter A in morse

        digitalWrite(LED_RED, HIGH);  // The LED is now turned off

        _delay_ms(200); // it stays off for 200 ms

        digitalWrite(LED_RED, LOW);   // The LED is turned on again for the second part of the letter A in morse 

        _delay_ms(500); // it stays on for 500 ms this time to represent the dash
        
        digitalWrite(LED_RED, HIGH); // The LED is turned off
        

        _delay_ms(200); // The loop starts again after 200 ms

    }
    
    // Will never reach this
    return 0;
}
```

2. Scheme of Morse code application, i.e. connection of AVR device, LED, resistor, and supply voltage. The image can be drawn on a computer or by hand. Always name all components and their values!
